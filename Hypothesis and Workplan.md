Hypothesis: The genes that were found to have roles in cancer treatment with wilfram A can be seen as changed within normal, non-cancer, cells.
Essentually want to retest the run they did in the original data set paper. In addtion I want to see if I can figure out the genes that were found to be up/downregulated and see thir "normal" uses. 

Original Data: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/565770
Paper for OG data: There is no paper for this study. There are a total of 6 runs within this study. Unknown if all should be done or if just to focus on one?

Primary literature that will help me in proving my hyothesis.
1. Withaferin A Induces Cell Death Selectively in Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Cells but Not in Normal Fibroblast Cells
2. Par-4-Dependent Apoptosis by the Dietary Compound Withaferin A in Prostate Cancer Cells
3. Withaferin A-Induced Apoptosis in Human Breast Cancer Cells Is Mediated by Reactive Oxygen Species

Background information:
Withaferin-A is a steroidal lactone that has been traditionally used as ayurvedic medication. While having roles in this type of medicine 
withaferin-A could play a role in various types of cancers by inducing apoptosis. In general this lactone upregulates and downregulates
a total of over 12,000 genes. Looking at these genes it becomes ideal to see what these up/downregulated genes normally do and to see if
the lacton is able to aid in overall cancer treatment. 

Pipeline:
Take Raw Data provided -> run QA/QC -> Use cutadapt to get rid of unwanted base pairs -> Do differential gene expression analysis compared to healthy cells -> Generate a write up and show some interesting gene expression differences.
