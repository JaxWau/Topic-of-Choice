November 6th Update
Downloaded SRA toolkit from NCBI so that I could download the SRA data I needed. 

Code for download: wget "http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz"
  Code taken from the NCBI GitHub that explained how to download and run the SRA Toolkit
Following the download of the toolkit I then un-tarred the file as in order to use it I needed to
  Code:  tar -xzf sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz
  This un tarred the program so that I could use it. Again, these steps were take from NCBI GitHub explaining the process. 

Nov 7th Update

Once the porgram was un-tarred I could change into its bin directory and being downloading my SRA reads. 

WA_01 download code: ./prefetch SRR10125328 (This downloaded the first read.) Then due to having the downloaded file be in a different
directory the following code was used to move it
  cp WA_01.sra ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/
  
Nov 9th Updates
Following the code listed in the Nov 7th update the following three reads were downloaded and moved into the new directory:
WA_02: ./prefetch SRR10125329
WA_03: ./prefetch SRR10125330

Following the succesful download of the WA reads, the .sra files then needed to be converted to .fasta/.fastq files. The following code was used
Due to me being unable to find code to convert .sra to .fastq the following code was used to re-download the SRA files for Withaferin-A reads
and the DMSO reads. 

Nov 11th, Update
Code for fasterq-dump
WA_01: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125328 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/Wilfarin_A/ (This code allowed me to download the SRA file as two .fastq files
that represented a froward read and a reverse read. It also put it into the Wilfarin_A directory)
WA_02: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125329 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/Wilfarin_A
WA_03: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125330 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/Wilfarin_A

Code for DMSO Fasterq-dump
D_01: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125325 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/DMSO
D_02: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125326 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/DMSO
D_03: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125327 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/DMSO

Nov 13th Updates
Downloaded the Human Genome and Transcriptome using the following commands
Reference Genome: wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-86/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
Following the download I then needed to unpackage the compressed file using this line of code: gunzip file.gtf.gz
The resulting file was a .fna or technically a fasta file which could then be used to map the reads to. 

Transcriptome: Need to figure this out.

November 16th Updates
RNASeq Pipline: Raw Reads -> QA/QC (fastqc and cuadapt) -> Mapping/alignment of reads with STAR -> transcript counting and assembly using RSEM ->
Generation of Count table and metadata for DESeq2 (obtaiend following assembly) -> DESeq2 for differential gene analysis -> Generation of graphs and charts to aid in
the showing of results.

Ran QA/QC for two reads W_01 and DMSO_1
Code for DMSO_1: fastqc DMSO_1_R1.fastq (for read 1) and fastqc DMSO_1_R2.fastq (for read 2)
Code for DMSO_2: fastqc DMSO_2_R1.fastq (for read 1) and fastqc DMSO_2_R2.fastq (for read 2)
Code for WA_1: fastq WA_1_R1.fastq (for read 1) and fastqc WA_1_R2.fastq (for read 2)
Code for WA_2: fastqc WA_2_R1.fastq (for read 1) and fastqc WA_2_R2.fastq (for read 2)

November 17th Update
Overall quality of reads seems good, only red "X" recived is on Sequence Duplicaiton Levels, otherwise no other issues with the reads. 
Reads are good following confirmation from Techtmann, primary reason is that there are so many reads and a lot of data. 

November 18th Update
Ran cutadapt with the following parameters on the fastqc files: cutadapt -q 20,20 -m 50 --max-n 0 -o  WA_1_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p WA_1_R2.cutadapt.fastq WA_1_R1.fastq WA_1_R2.fastq
Following cutadapt completion (0.2%) or 14,530,079 reads were cut. Due to this not having a strong impact on data, cutadapt was not
used for furthur runs. 
Also rechecked fastqc following cuadapt to see if there were any differences or if data actually needed to be cutadapted. 
Began work on presentation and paper: essentially got ppt and paper formatted with a litte data here and there.

November 22nd Update
Ran cutadapt for the remaining WA and DMSO reads using the same code as used on the 17th. Also added more to the paper and presentation. 
WA_2:cutadapt -q 20,20 -m 50 --max-n 0 -o  WA_2_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p WA_2_R2.cutadapt.fastq WA_2_R1.fastq WA_2_R2.fastq
DMSO 1: cutadapt -q 20,20 -m 50 --max-n 0 -o  DMSO_1_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p DMSO_1_R2.cutadapt.fastq DMSO_1_R1.fastq DMSO_1_R2.fastq
DMSO 2: cutadapt -q 20,20 -m 50 --max-n 0 -o  DMSO_2_R1.cutadapt.fastq -p DMSO_2_R2.cutadapt.fastq DMSO_2_R1.fastq DMSO_2_R2.fastq

After using cutadapt on the reads, while the overall amount of bases was small (.2%) some issues were aliveated. 

Also generated the genome index for use with STAR. Code shown below
gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.86.gtf.gz
gunzip Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz

Code for index: STAR --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir star_data --genomeFastaFiles Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa --sjdbGTFfile Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.86.gt

Following this RSEM will be run and RStudio will be used for final analysis. Will need to being on paper and presentaiton.

November 24th Update
Began adding to paper and presentation. Knocked out "Backgroung/Into" and part of methods. Will need to add more as the week progresses
and will need to run the reads through STAR and RSEM.
