November 6th Update
Downloaded SRA toolkit from NCBI so that I could download the SRA data I needed. 

Code for download: wget "http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz"
  Code taken from the NCBI GitHub that explained how to download and run the SRA Toolkit
Following the download of the toolkit I then un-tarred the file as in order to use it I needed to
  Code:  tar -xzf sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz
  This un tarred the program so that I could use it. Again, these steps were take from NCBI GitHub explaining the process. 

Nov 7th Update

Once the porgram was un-tarred I could change into its bin directory and being downloading my SRA reads. 

WA_01 download code: ./prefetch SRR10125328 (This downloaded the first read.) Then due to having the downloaded file be in a different
directory the following code was used to move it
  cp WA_01.sra ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/
  
Nov 9th Updates
Following the code listed in the Nov 7th update the following three reads were downloaded and moved into the new directory:
WA_02: ./prefetch SRR10125329
WA_03: ./prefetch SRR10125330

Following the succesful download of the WA reads, the .sra files then needed to be converted to .fasta/.fastq files. The following code was used
  Code: (Will go here once code is figured out.)
