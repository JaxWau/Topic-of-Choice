# Topic-of-Choice

This is a repo to put all of the topic of choice project information. 
Topic: Differential Gene Expression of prostate cancer via targeting of withaferin A. This is a steroidal lactone that has been traditionally used as an anti-inflammatory. The study that I took the data from showed that there are mechanistic targets of the lactone in prostate cancer cells. 


What to test: See what genes are actually upregulated / downregulated and changed when withaferin A is used to treat the cells. While the paper says there were at least 6000 for both up and downregulation maybe focus on just a few that are either named or that are found while researching the topic. 
Hypothesis:
