November 6th Update
Downloaded SRA toolkit from NCBI so that I could download the SRA data I needed. 

Code for download: wget "http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz"
  Code taken from the NCBI GitHub that explained how to download and run the SRA Toolkit
Following the download of the toolkit I then un-tarred the file as in order to use it I needed to
  Code:  tar -xzf sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz
  This un tarred the program so that I could use it. Again, these steps were take from NCBI GitHub explaining the process.
