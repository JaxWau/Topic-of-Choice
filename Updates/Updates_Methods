November 6th Update
Downloaded SRA toolkit from NCBI so that I could download the SRA data I needed. 

Code for download: wget "http://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sdk/current/sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz"
  Code taken from the NCBI GitHub that explained how to download and run the SRA Toolkit
Following the download of the toolkit I then un-tarred the file as in order to use it I needed to
  Code:  tar -xzf sratoolkit.current-centos_linux64.tar.gz
  This un tarred the program so that I could use it. Again, these steps were take from NCBI GitHub explaining the process. 

Nov 7th Update

Once the porgram was un-tarred I could change into its bin directory and being downloading my SRA reads. 

WA_01 download code: ./prefetch SRR10125328 (This downloaded the first read.) Then due to having the downloaded file be in a different
directory the following code was used to move it
  cp WA_01.sra ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/
  
Nov 9th Updates
Following the code listed in the Nov 7th update the following three reads were downloaded and moved into the new directory:
WA_02: ./prefetch SRR10125329
WA_03: ./prefetch SRR10125330

Following the succesful download of the WA reads, the .sra files then needed to be converted to .fasta/.fastq files. The following code was used
Due to me being unable to find code to convert .sra to .fastq the following code was used to re-download the SRA files for Withaferin-A reads
and the DMSO reads. 

Nov 11th, Update
Code for fasterq-dump
WA_01: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125328 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/Wilfarin_A/ (This code allowed me to download the SRA file as two .fastq files
that represented a froward read and a reverse read. It also put it into the Wilfarin_A directory)
WA_02: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125329 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/Wilfarin_A
WA_03: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125330 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/Wilfarin_A

Code for DMSO Fasterq-dump
D_01: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125325 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/DMSO
D_02: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125326 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/DMSO
D_03: ./fasterq-dump SRR10125327 -O ~/scratch/topic_of_Choice/DMSO

Nov 13th Updates
Downloaded the Human Genome and Transcriptome using the following commands
Reference Genome: wget http://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-86/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa.gz
Following the download I then needed to unpackage the compressed file using this line of code: gunzip file.gtf.gz
The resulting file was a .fna or technically a fasta file which could then be used to map the reads to. 

Transcriptome: Need to figure this out.

November 16th Updates
RNASeq Pipline: Raw Reads -> QA/QC (fastqc and cuadapt) -> bowtie2/mapping program (map reads to Human Genome) might need to modify reads to they map better
-> N/A (need to figure out what to do here. Maybe STAR/RStudio)Essentially need a table to insert into R for DESeq2.

Ran QA/QC for two reads W_01 and DMSO_1
Code for DMSO_1: fastqc DMSO_1_R1.fastq (for read 1) and fastqc DMSO_1_R2.fastq (for read 2)
Code for DMSO_2: fastqc DMSO_2_R1.fastq (for read 1) and fastqc DMSO_2_R2.fastq (for read 2)
Code for WA_1: fastq WA_1_R1.fastq (for read 1) and fastqc WA_1_R2.fastq (for read 2)
Code for WA_2: fastqc WA_2_R1.fastq (for read 1) and fastqc WA_2_R2.fastq (for read 2)
